"""validate-plan.py — mechanical gate on the EM's task plan (D-26, D-28).

The plan (tasks/plan.json) is the EM's only channel of authority. Everything
checkable is checked here, so a bad decomposition fails at VALIDATION, not at
integration:

  - structural: schema shape, no unknown keys, no status field, id format
  - atomicity:  exactly one file per task, unique, under the build lane
  - coverage:   every file in the exact active milestone inventory has one task
  - oracle:     every frozen TPM test node-id that observably exercises this
                delta's inventory (module-level import of a task-owned module,
                or an AST-visible call to a route a task claims) is mapped to
                exactly one task; the rest are carried-forward regression
                tests, COMPUTED here — never EM-emitted (D-57) — whose
                acceptance point is the final full-suite run
  - contracts:  every referenced contract id exists in the frozen contracts
  - DAG:        dependencies exist, no self-deps, acyclic (Kahn)
  - routing:    a mapped test that exercises an HTTP route (AST-visible
                client.<method>("<path>") literal) must not be scheduled
                before the task claiming that route contract — the route
                must be claimed inside the task's dependency closure
  - freshness:  plan.erd_version == scripts/.approved/VERSION

Stdlib only (json/hashlib), matching the orchestrator's pre-flight contract.

                                            for every milestone node-id — one
                                            deterministic task per file, the EM
                                            never called. Exits 1 with the reasons

                                            still faces the FULL validate() gate —
                                            this command is a producer, never an

                                            files are new, which node-ids the EM

                                            (Cut 2: exactly one re-emit, no new

                                            the PREVIOUS spec, not this one).
                                            Exits 1 with the reason whenever a
                                            subtree re-plan cannot soundly express
                                            the delta — the orchestrator then
                                            falls back to full emission.
  validate-plan.py --merge-subtree PRIOR SUBTREE SCOPE

                                            delta needed no EM tasks). The merged
                                            artifact then faces the FULL validate()
                                            gate unchanged — the D-64 bijection is
                                            a property of the validated artifact,
                                            not of who authored which part.
  validate-plan.py --construct-one-file PRIOR SCOPE

                                            trivial_construct scope — the prior
                                            task's brief, contracts and
                                            depends_on carried through, only

                                            plan, print each edge. Exit 0 always;
                                            validate() runs after and is the
                                            authority. Monotone (edges only push
                                            tests later), so it can never make a
                                            bad plan pass. Run by orchestrate.sh
                                            before the gate.

# restate carried behavior the delta leaves untouched. em.md has said so in
# prose since v82, but prose is a suggestion, not a rule — and the mechanical
# synthesis lane (B3) copies the TPM's verbatim brief, which legitimately names
# carried symbols for context, so the check cannot simply forbid mentioning
# carried behavior. It must separate TPM-authorized context from EM-introduced
# restatement. The rule (enforced fail-closed in validate(), mirroring the D-89
# "name the source, suggest the fix" shape): for an EXISTING file whose plan
# brief DIVERGES from the TPM verbatim brief, flag any backticked code symbol
# the brief names that (a) is DEFINED in the current on-disk file — i.e.
# carried, pre-existing behavior — AND (b) appears NOWHERE in the ERD-DELTA the
# TPM authored. That symbol is behavior the delta does not change, restated.
#
# DECISIONS — the "do NOT fire / do NOT suggest" boundary (S6, 2026-08-08: an
# over-strict gate that halts every freeze is worse than none — this check
# fails OPEN unless every precondition for a sound verdict holds, and only then
# fails CLOSED with a named, bounded diagnosis):
#   * Verbatim TPM briefs are the authority. A plan brief equal (whitespace-
#     normalized) to the file's `_parse_brief_blocks` block is exempt outright,
#     so the synthesis path can NEVER be rejected by this gate (item-4
#     constraint). The symbol heuristic would already pass such a brief; the
#     explicit equality skip makes it an invariant, not an inference.
#   * No ERD-DELTA.md, or no verbatim brief block for the file → skip. Without
#     the TPM's authored delta there is no ground truth for "what the delta
#     changes"; firing blind is the S6 failure. The gate speaks only when it
#     has an authority to compare against.
#   * A new file (nothing on disk / no defined symbols) carries no behavior to
#     restate → skip. Grandfathering by construction: a symbol the delta
#     introduces is not yet defined in the file, so it can never be flagged;
#     only a symbol the file ALREADY defines can be.
#   * Only backticked identifiers that resolve to a symbol the file DEFINES
#     (def/class/function/const/let/var) fire — never prose, type names, or
#     un-backticked words. The offender list is capped (bounded diagnosis).
