# drive-plan.sh — selftest harness for orchestrate.sh's ensure_plan
# (D-79 spec-defect rung + the Fix A subtree re-plan path).
#
# Exercises the REAL functions (extracted from orchestrate.sh at run time,
# never copied — a copy would silently drift) against a scripted fake EM,
# exactly like drive-consult.sh: the pytest side stages numbered raw replies
# in <workdir>/replies/N, this driver wires a stub llm-call.sh that plays
# them back in call order (recording each prompt in prompts/N), then runs
# ensure_plan against whatever frozen spec the pytest side staged under
# scripts/.approved/ (and src/ tree, for the D-79 audit's registration scan).
#
# The interesting exits:
#   0 — plan validated
#   1 — plan budget exhausted, spec audit PASSED (actor-path halt, die)
#   2 — plan budget exhausted, spec audit FAILED (D-79 SPEC DEFECT ->
#       TPM bundle; finalize_batch's exit code)
# .calls holds the number of EM calls consumed — the D-79 path must not
# burn more than MAX_PLAN_REVISIONS of them.
#
# Usage: drive-plan.sh <workdir>
