# update-template.sh — pull the template's control plane into this child (D-34).
#
# The refreeze pattern (D-31) applied to the OTHER protected artifact class:
# stage the template's current template-owned files, show one diff and the
# template's own commit-message claims for the update range, apply, re-pin
# hashes, advance .template-version, commit [template-update <sha>]. This
# is the fix for the spark-class incident — control-plane improvements
# flow template -> children instead of by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   update-template.sh [--from <clone-dir>] [--ref <ref>] [--dry-run] [--review]
#   update-template.sh --approve <sha> [--from <clone-dir>] [--ref <ref>]
#   update-template.sh --interactive [--from <clone-dir>] [--ref <ref>]
#   update-template.sh --stamp [--from <clone-dir>]
#
#   --from     use an existing local clone of the template (else: gh repo clone
#              into a temp dir — needs gh auth for a private template)
#   --ref      template ref to update to (default: the clone's HEAD)
#   --dry-run  show what would change and exit; no tty needed, nothing written.
#              Prints the DIFF-SHA the --approve mode binds to.
#   --review   emit a self-contained review bundle (claims + diff + reviewer
#              instructions) for pasting into a SECOND model before applying;
#              no tty needed, nothing written. Delegates the technical read.
#   --approve <sha>
#              explicit apply, D-61 (the D-42 refreeze pattern applied here):
#              the sha must match the recomputed diff hash, so what is
#              applied is byte-bound to what was reviewed. If the template or
#              the child changed since --dry-run, the hash mismatches and
#              nothing is written. Same honest caveat as D-42: a conductor
#              relays the diff, so the CEO's read is only as good as the relay
#              — the raw diff is deterministic and re-printable at any time.
#   --interactive
#              opt-in y/N prompt (the pre-D-96 default). For the rare case
#              where the operator wants to eyeball this specific pull before
#              it applies. Requires a terminal.
#   --stamp    only (re)write ref= in .template-version to the template's HEAD —
#              retrofits a child created before D-33. No files are copied.
#
# Default is auto (D-96, mirrors D-95): on all pre-diff checks green
# (clone resolvable, template manifest present, diff computable), the pull
# applies without a prompt. Correctness is carried by the template's own
# selftests (which ran green before the template committed) and the next
# run's gates in this child; the post-apply `phase-gate.sh manifest HEAD`
# still fails closed on integrity mismatch. The plain-language CLAIMS are
# printed on every invocation so a conductor or reviewer can react.
