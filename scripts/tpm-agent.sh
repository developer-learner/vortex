# tpm-agent.sh — launch the TPM as a scoped repo agent (D-39).
#
# D-139: the TPM is a CEO-assigned seat — run this only after the CEO names
# this agent as the TPM holder for the session. D-38 kept the TPM chat-side
# with an air gap; D-39 promotes it to a repo agent on the CEO's explicit
# decision, with the containment D-38(b) recorded:
#
#   WRITE lane   .tpm/outbox/ only (harness-allowed; everything protected is
#                harness-denied; anything else prompts the operator). Nothing
#                installs from the outbox except through the automatic
#                preflight-green apply in scripts/refreeze.sh (D-121 — the
#                old human y/N approval is retired); hash-pinned after.
#   READ wall    src/ is harness-denied and Bash is denied entirely (no
#                `cat src/...` bypass). Oracle independence (INV-1): the TPM
#                authors tests without ever seeing the implementation.
#   NO PROCEDURE the TPM triggers nothing — orchestrate.sh, refreeze.sh, EM
#                and coder runs are all operator- or shell-initiated.
#
# Honest layer statement: the read wall is harness-enforced (softer than the
# chat air gap — that fallback remains: tpm-pack.sh/tpm-unpack.sh, D-38).
# The write wall is layered and hard: harness deny + operator ask-prompts +
# hash-pinned manifests failing closed + the automatic preflight-green
# apply in scripts/refreeze.sh (D-121, no interactive approval step).
#
# Usage: tpm-agent.sh [--view]   (from the project root; requires the `claude` CLI)
#   default:  agent rooted at the repo root, read wall harness-enforced (D-39)
#   --view:   build the materialized TPM view (tpm-view.sh, D-162) and root the
#             agent there — src/ is physically absent, INV-1 read side is
#             structural rather than a settings promise
