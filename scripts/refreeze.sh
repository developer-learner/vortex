# refreeze.sh — the ONLY path by which frozen TPM artifacts change (D-31).
#
# The TPM (frontier LLM in a human-operated web chat) authors the spec: PRD,
# ERD prose, machine-readable contracts, and the test suite. The operator
# saves the TPM's output (initial spec or an escalation delta) under a staging
# directory and runs this script, which:
#
#   1. runs every mechanical preflight (D-56 externals, D-78 satisfiability,
#      D-87 static-asset reachability, D-88 smoke-check quotes, INV-4 test
#      surface, staged-test parse+lint+determinism),
#   2. shows the full diff and its DIFF-SHA,
#   3. applies automatically when every preflight is green (D-95, then
#      D-121): the y/N and hash-bound approvals were ceremonial once every
#      material check already ran — a verdict nobody consumes is not a gate.
#      The CEO ruling (2026-08-06): "remove ceo approval for refreeze run —
#      the business ceo or human can't add any value there." There is NO
#      human approval step in this lane; halts on any preflight failure
#      with the specific finding. --diff remains as a read-only dry-run
#      preview (prints the diff and DIFF-SHA, applies nothing).
#   4. applies the files, re-collects test node-ids, records the delta,
#   5. re-freezes: bumps VERSION, regenerates the hash manifest,
#      commits [refreeze vN].
#
# Wrongness gets a protocol instead of a workaround: frozen artifacts can be
# legitimately revised (bounded, versioned, gate-approved) and can NEVER be
# silently mutated — every gate run verifies the frozen-manifest, fail-closed.
#
# Usage:
#   refreeze.sh [<staging-dir>]             auto: preflight-green → apply
#                                           (D-95/D-121; halts on any
#                                           preflight failure)
#   refreeze.sh --diff [<staging-dir>]      validate + print full diff and its
#                                           DIFF-SHA, apply nothing (read-only
#                                           preview; the install is the same
#                                           command without the flag)

# mechanically recognizable sections. The checker also proves that newly
# introduced AC ids and contracts.changed_files occur in that delta.
# A non-behavioral standing-ERD refresh retires the prior delta automatically:
# folding the completed milestone into standing architecture is the explicit
# consolidation point, and the next EM cannot mistake the old slice for new.
# --- D-136: staged contracts merge (PRODUCER, never authority) ---------------
# contracts.json enters as a STAGED MERGE ARTIFACT, not a full-file
# replacement: the TPM stages only changed/new id-array entries (each
# `file`-pinned) plus D-137's explicit family-scoped `remove` tombstones;
# contracts-merge.py reconstructs the full contracts.json by overlaying them
# onto the standing file, proving mechanically that it touched nothing it did
# not name (byte-identical carried remainder; a staged entry identical to
# standing fails closed; omission never deletes). The merge runs BEFORE every
# contracts-consuming gate so each sees the MERGED file, never the raw partial:
# check-spec-delta (D-107/D-122 — a partial would read every omitted id-array
# as changed and defeat the invisible-change guard), D-56, INV-4, the D-78
# preflight, the DELTA, the apply, the manifest. The merge is transparent — the
# gates see the same full contracts a return would have produced. At v1 (no
# standing) the staged file IS the full spec, so no merge runs. Runs in --diff
