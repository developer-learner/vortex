# phase-gate.sh <em|task|manifest> [phase-start-ref] [task-target]
# Inverted whitelist gate: fail if the phase touched anything outside its
# permitted lane. Defaults to diffing against current HEAD; pass a
# phase-start ref (recorded before the agent ran) to catch committed changes.
#
# Phases:
#   em        — tasks/ only (the EM's sole write lane, D-26)
#   task      — EXACTLY ONE file may change: the task target passed as $3
#               (structural atomicity for the coder, D-26)
#   manifest  — integrity checks only (control plane + frozen spec); used by
#               the orchestrator pre-flight and the pre-commit hook
#
# Retired 2026-07-22 (D-25/D-37 amended): the `build`, `test`, and
# `architect` phases + their INV-3 check ran under the pre-D-53 architecture
# where distinct agent tiers wrote src/, tests/, and docs/. Post-D-53 only
# the shell writes those paths (coder via `task`, EM via `em`, tests only
# via refreeze); nothing invokes the retired phases and INV-3 sat unrun for
# ~3 weeks, so keeping them was mechanical theater. The build_dir/test_dir
# path readers here went with them — orchestrate.sh and validate-plan.py
# read `build=` from `.gate-paths` themselves for their pathing needs.
