# orchestrate.sh v3 — walks the EM's task DAG from a frozen TPM spec.
#
# Shell owns ALL procedure (D-05 applied uniformly, D-26): ordering, state,
# completion, escalation counters. LLM tiers only produce artifacts:
#   EM    -> tasks/plan.json (decomposition) and tasks/diagnosis.json (consults)
#   coder -> exactly one file per task, gate-enforced
# Tests are TPM-authored, frozen in scripts/.approved/ + tests/, and RUN by
# this script via pytest --json-report. There is no test-authoring agent.
#
# D-53: EM/coder are called over bare HTTP (scripts/llm-call.sh), one
# completion per call — no agent harness in the loop. The shell gathers
# context (reads the frozen files a call needs) into the prompt, sends it,
# and writes the model's answer to disk itself: a JSON artifact for the EM
# (schema-constrained), the one named file for the coder (sentinel-wrapped,
# same convention refreeze/tpm-unpack already use). This retires the
# `opencode serve` / `--attach` / agent-mode machinery (D-40..D-52), whose
# seams caused every failure of the first three supervised runs and caught
# none of them — the actual trust boundary was always the sandbox lanes and
# the gates below, never the harness.
#
# The TPM is a human-operated web chat: escalations are packaged as batched,
# copy-pasteable bundles under .pipeline-state/escalations/ (D-29), and its
# answers come back as a delta applied by scripts/refreeze.sh (D-31).
#
# Exit codes: 0 feature done (delta-mapped tests green) · 1 hard failure or
# gate violation · 2 halted awaiting TPM (escalation batch written).
#
# Verdict scope (D-112): milestone completion is judged by the delta's
# dependent set — the union of every test node-id the plan mapped — never by
# the carried-forward suite. The FULL frozen suite is an on-demand regression
# check: scripts/orchestrate.sh --full-suite.

# Wave 1 (D-107-class): the required plan/task keys, named verbatim in every
# plan-emission prompt. The EM is stateless (D-53) and response_format is only
# advisory when the server ignores it; naming keys inline stops the model
# inventing key names (observed 2026-08-02 model-add: top-level "plan" for
# "tasks", per-task "test_nodes" for "tests").
EM_TASK_KEYS='SCHEMA — name these keys verbatim; the validator rejects any others. Top-level object: {"erd_version": N, "version": N, "tasks": [ ... ]} — the tasks array is under the key "tasks" (never "plan"). Each task object has EXACTLY these six keys: {"id": "...", "file": "...", "depends_on": [], "brief": "...", "contracts": [], "tests": ["<node-id>", ...]}. The names test_nodes, acceptance, regression, and status are NOT valid task keys and are rejected.'
# Phase 3: the never-invent-contract-id rule, stated verbatim at every
# plan-emission site next to EM_TASK_KEYS. The rule alone was inoperative —
# the EM still emitted dotted-path guesses like "src.api.models" for
# "src/api/models.py" (5 of 32 archived plan-gate rejections, all subtree
# re-plans) — so the shell also prints the flat verbatim id list (contract_ids)
# the validator accepts. Copying beats deriving.
EM_CONTRACT_ID_RULE='CONTRACT IDS — the task "contracts" array holds ONLY exact strings from the valid-id list the shell prints after this rule (or is empty). Copy ids VERBATIM: a registered id is its exact string — never convert a file path to dotted form (src/api/models.py is a path; "src.api.models" is not a registered id), never add or drop a file extension, never invent a prefix. The validator rejects any contracts entry not on the list.'

  # D-124: the verbatim id list is scoped to this milestone, not the
  # accumulated all-milestone dump. Entries whose owner file is in the plan
  # inventory are kept; unattributable ids (ui/external) are kept only when
  # the inventory is frontend or ERD-DELTA names them; entry_points are kept
  # by module match. The validator + contract-repair still reject/drop
  # anything the scope misses, and an empty contracts array is always legal.

Reply with ONLY edit blocks in this exact format, nothing else:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
(an EXACT, character-for-character copy of a short existing section — 3 to 10 lines)
=======
(that same section with the change applied)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
Rules:
- Each SEARCH must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the file. Copy it verbatim — same spaces, same quotes.
- Several small blocks, not one big one. Do not touch code outside your blocks. Do not reformat or reorder anything.
- Never include any line containing a think tag in a SEARCH section — anchor on nearby tag-free lines instead.
- In new code, never write the think tag as one literal string — construct it by concatenation, e.g. '<' + 'think>'.
- If the file already satisfies the brief, reply with exactly this line and nothing else: === NO CHANGES ===
- Verify each SEARCH against the file one more time before answering.
- Your reply's VERY FIRST line must be '<<<<<<< SEARCH' (or the NO CHANGES line). Do not analyze, plan, or explain anything — every design decision is already made in the brief. Prose before the blocks burns your output budget and truncates the edit mid-block.
- Every block must be COMPLETE working code — never a stub, placeholder, or '...' body. If the brief needs a new function, write its full body in the block."

Reply with ONLY this, nothing before or after it:

Your reply's VERY FIRST line must be the === FILE: line. Do not analyze,

# testchat M29 that list held 3 of 12 files, so when .pipeline-state/tasks/

# call away from rewriting app.js, chat.py, threads.py, index.html and
# websearch.py — none of which the delta touched. Nothing mechanical would
# have stopped it.
#
# So the default is inverted: a file the current delta does not touch is
# no-edit, rather than fair game. The permitted set is derived from the
# frozen delta (never hand-listed, so it cannot drift), using the same
# --affected computation the re-freeze reset uses — direct hits plus
# transitive dependents, which is precisely the pipeline's own notion of
