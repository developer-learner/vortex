# bootstrap.sh — Run once when starting a new project from this template
#
# Usage: ./scripts/bootstrap.sh <project-name>
#
# What it does:
#   1. Renames placeholders throughout docs
#   2. Creates AGENTS.md symlink → CLAUDE.md (OpenCode's preferred filename)
#   3. Creates Python virtual environment
#   4. Installs base dependencies
#   5. Initializes git (if not already)
#   6. Prints next steps
#
# NOTE (Rule 3): This installs the DEFAULT stack (FastAPI + Postgres async).
# If this project uses a different stack (e.g. SQLite, Django, no DB), EDIT
# the dependency list below BEFORE running. Also update ci.yml and CONVENTIONS.md.
