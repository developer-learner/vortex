# manifest-drift-guard.sh — warning-only drift advisory (2026-08-08).
#
# The gate (phase-gate.sh manifest) DETECTS control-plane drift fail-closed,
# but nothing prevented INTRODUCING it: a control-plane doc edit lands
# without regenerating the manifest, and the NEXT commit goes red with a
# manual re-pin needed (recurred twice: 2026-06-30, 2026-08-03 7537d83).
# This hook de-risks the introduce: BEFORE the fail-closed manifest check,
# it warns when a STAGED control-plane file's hash differs from the
# manifest, printing the exact repair command. Warning-only, exit 0 always
# — the gate stays the enforcement point.
#
# Why warning-only: control-plane docs have no runtime blast radius (only
# phase-gate reads them), matching the D-115 gate-strength rule and the
# doc-consistency.sh precedent; auto-regen stays banned (Rule 3: it would
# bless any CLAUDE.md change instead of an intended one).
#
# Usage: manifest-drift-guard.sh [--root ROOT]
#        (--root defaults to the git toplevel)
# Exit: 0 always (warning). Silent when no staged control-plane file drifts.
