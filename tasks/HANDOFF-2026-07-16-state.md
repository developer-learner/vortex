## Where the template stands

- HEAD `e2077f7`, pushed to origin, working tree clean, CI green.
- **66 selftests green** (was 61). Decisions through **D-71**.
- Landed this session (2026-07-16), one concern per commit:
  - `959a663` **D-71** EM diagnosis hardened: `task_id` removed from the
    reply surface (the shell stamps it — the M23 empty-task_id failure is
    structurally impossible), inline literal example in the consult prompt,
    one retry carrying the validator's errors before the halt. First
    selftests for `consult_em` (`scripts/selftest/drive-consult.sh` extracts
    the REAL functions from orchestrate.sh and drives them against a
    scripted fake EM — never a copy).
  - `cbd9285` fix: every create-mode (new-file) coder call had been dead
    since the M17 edit-budget change — orchestrate exports
    `SWBP_MAX_OUTPUT=""` for create mode and `int(os.environ.get(v, 0))`
    raises on empty (default covers unset, not empty). Now `int(... or 0)`.
  - `b24c335` fix: pre-flight fails closed on missing git identity — the
    `[plan]`/`[task]` commits swallow failures on purpose (nothing-to-commit
    is normal), which also swallowed "no user.email", so every pipeline
    commit in the dev VM silently no-op'd.
  - `8e35ef0` / `9bd98bc` / `e2077f7` — handoff/ledger bookkeeping.

## Gate validation ledger (Rule 6: untriggered ≠ working)

Live-fire status after the **scratch-rung ladder drill** (2026-07-16):
a disposable child (since deleted on CEO directive) whose ERD said
`double(n) = n*2` while its frozen test demanded `double(2) == 5` — the
contradiction lived only in the PRD, which EM/coder never see. Two runs,
both halting exit 2 with a self-contained bundle.

Plus the **scratch-decomp drill** (2026-07-16, later same day): a second
disposable child (since deleted on CEO directive, like scratch-rung —
evidence lives in this ledger) with a clean
two-file spec (`api.compute` must delegate to `helpers.scale`) and a
rigged plan — T1 (`src/api.py`) with `depends_on: []` so the frozen
delegation test fails on the missing helper. One run, exit 0.

| Gate | Live fire | Evidence |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Ladder: retry rung (strike 1→2) | ✅ | both drill runs + testchat M23 + **linkbox M1 (first organic fire on a real run)**: T2 attempt 1 called `update_bookmark(id, **fields)` against a `(id, fields: dict)` signature; retry with failure appended fixed it on attempt 2 |
| Ladder: EM consult | ✅ | 4 consults: 3 across the scratch-rung runs + 1 in scratch-decomp |
| Ladder: D-71 diagnosis validation | ✅ | **3/3 observed diagnoses schema-valid first-try**; run 2's was factually perfect (named the node-id, quoted the 4≠5 contradiction). The scratch-decomp diagnosis was valid (route fired) but its stdout didn't survive, so first-try vs D-71-retry is unknown for that one |
| Ladder: D-71 retry rung | ◐ | 5 selftests + live probes green; never OBSERVED needed live (all observed diagnoses passed first-try) |
| Verdict routing: `brief_wrong` | ✅ | run 1 — revision applied, strikes reset, re-ran |
| Verdict routing: `contract_or_test_wrong` | ✅ | run 2 — routed straight to spec-wrong escalation |
| Verdict routing: `decomposition_wrong` | ✅ | scratch-decomp drill — EM re-emitted plan v2 (T1 gained `depends_on: ["T2"]`, child `4ff5faa`), re-validated, strikes reset, run finished green (`66c6b9b`, 6/6 frozen tests) |
| TPM bundle + BATCH.md + exit 2 | ✅ | both kinds: caps-exhausted (run 1), spec-wrong (run 2); bundles self-contained with embedded diagnosis |
| Plan gate: bounded revisions + halt | ✅ | linkbox M1 run 1 — EM omitted top-level `version` twice (prompt defect, fixed `d6aa3f4` + selftest); halted clean after 2/2 with the correct operator message |
| D-65 no_edit_files | ✅ | testchat M23 (4 no-op tasks skipped coder) |
| D-67 refreeze lint | ✅ | live-triggered via lint-bait (2026-07-15) |
| D-68 swallowed-error | ◐ | has never yet FAILED a live coder attempt |
| D-69 run budget | ❌ | never breached; timing table works |
| b24c335 git-identity pre-flight | ◐ | selftest-free one-liner; will live-fire on any identity-less clone |

## Top open template work

1. **Opportunistic rung** — a live D-71 retry (`decomposition_wrong` closed
   via the scratch-decomp drill). Selftest-covered; not forceable
   deterministically — all live diagnoses so far have been schema-valid
   first-try. When a real child consult produces one, capture it here.
2. **ci.yml never syncs to children** (`.manifest-project`): hand-apply CI
   fixes to existing children (testchat: done, `6ba8cc2` + `f79f0d2`). New
   children inherit via clone.
3. Standing backlog: coverage ratchet after CI measures testchat's suite;
   cheap-tier publish decision (CEO's, still open); EM-collapse experiment
   and TurboQuant bench (icebox); LM Studio housekeeping (delete
   `unsloth/qwen3.6-27b-mlx`, benched strictly worse).

## Running the pipeline — facts that cost time this session

- **Split-brain execution model:** the freeze ceremony (`refreeze.sh`) runs
  on the **macOS host** (homebrew ruff + podman; start the machine first:
  `podman machine start`). `orchestrate.sh` runs **only inside dev-vm**
  (hard die on Darwin). Sandbox images are per-side — host podman and VM
  podman are separate stores; a cold build is ~10 min of pip install.
  Pre-warm with `scripts/sandbox-run.sh -- true` on BOTH sides before a
  first run, or refreeze/orchestrate will eat the build inside a timeout.
- **VM run invocation** (from the child dir; the host `~/dev` mount is
  writable in the VM):
  `limactl shell dev-vm -- bash -c 'SANDBOX_LLM_HOST=host.lima.internal SANDBOX_LLM_PORT=8000 bash scripts/orchestrate.sh'`
  — orchestrate's pre-flight curl does NOT read models.env; without those
  exports it probes localhost:1234 and dies.
- **Model seating:** VM `~/.config/sw-dev-blueprint/models.env` maps both
  seats to `mtplx-qwen36-27b-optimized-quality` @ host.lima.internal:8000
  (verified live this session). The VM copy is the one the pipeline reads;
  the host copy (`qwen/qwen3.6-27b` @ 1234) serves host-side probes only.
  CEO-owned — see the models.env rules in CLAUDE.md's correction log.
- **VM git identity is set globally** (`Arc Elixir <developer.learner@outlook.com>`,
  updated 2026-07-17 — previously placeholder `pipeline@dev-vm.local` /
  `swbp-pipeline` was set at repo level in linkbox as a workaround; that and
  a matching `Developer <dev@testchat.local>` override in sw-dev-blueprint
  itself have been unset). Pre-flight enforces identity presence (`b24c335`).
  Do not re-introduce placeholder identities per-repo — global covers all
  children.
- **Children cloned from the local template** need `git pull --no-rebase`
  (no pull.rebase default configured). Git identity is inherited from the
  VM's global config; no per-child setup required.
- **A deliberate full-ladder run needs a bigger budget**: it has more phases
  than a healthy run by design — `SWBP_RUN_BUDGET=2400` worked; the default
  1200 is for healthy runs.
- docs/ and ci.yml never sync to children; verify syncs by content not exit
  code; both manifests regen in the same commit; probe after every seat
  change.

## Child status (one line each)

- **testchat**: spec v45, M24 CEO-accepted (`ab0f983`), main == origin,
  maintenance mode, CI green. Its `tasks/CURRENT.md` carries the milestone
  chronicle + TPM lessons.
- **spark / sparkv2**: pre-capability-ladder, untouched by design — never
  run `update-template.sh` on them.
- **scratch-rung**: deleted 2026-07-16 post-drill (CEO directive). Its
  evidence lives in the ledger above, the two fix commits, and CLAUDE.md's
  correction log — not in the child.
- **scratch-decomp**: deleted 2026-07-16 post-drill (CEO directive), same
  policy — evidence in the ledger above.
- **linkbox** (NEW, 2026-07-16): first real (non-drill) child — a personal
  read-later bookmarks API (FastAPI + stdlib sqlite3, 2-file inventory).
  Cloned from template `65cc863`, bootstrapped, both manifests regen'd,
  tree clean at `[bootstrap]`. Spec v1 staged in
  `scripts/.approved/incoming/` (PRD, ERD, contracts, 21 frozen tests —
  verified 21/21 against a throwaway reference impl, deleted). Staging is
  gitignored: if it vanishes before the freeze, the backup lives in the
  authoring session's scratchpad. **M1 BUILT same day** (`[success] spec
  v1`, `471499a`): frozen v1 at `d3fdfdf`; run 1 halted on the plan-gate
  prompt defect (fixed, `d6aa3f4`); run 2 went plan → T1 (attempt 1) →
  T2 (attempt 2, organic retry-rung fire) → full suite green. App
  smoke-verified end-to-end (create/409/tag-filter/patch/unread/delete).
  **CEO-ACCEPTED same day (D-44, `60d9b96`)**: /docs by hand, an
  independent LLM black-box pass (16/16), and restart persistence
  verified. Child `tasks/` de-templated (own BACKLOG; template handoffs
  removed). M2 direction open — the CEO's call.
